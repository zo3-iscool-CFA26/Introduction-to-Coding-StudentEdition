# Weekly Lesson Plans (18 Weeks)

Course alignment source:
[Introduction_to_Coding.md](../Introduction_to_Coding.md).

The individual homework follows a semester-long story, **BranchQuest: The
Apprentice Maker's Chronicle**, in which students play a new apprentice at a
game-maker's guild building a class text adventure. Recurring characters, the
cumulative game they build, and the per-week story beats are introduced in
[../course-materials/branchquest-map.md](../course-materials/branchquest-map.md).
Each week is framed as a **quest branch** submitted by **merge request**; see
[github-workflow-and-submission.md](./github-workflow-and-submission.md).
